## Welcome!!
My name is [Dean Abdelnaby](mailto:abdelnabydean@gmail.com). I am currently an undergraduate student at UC Davis 
majoring in Genes and Genomics 😁.

I am interested in bioinformatics and the numbers behind certain biological patterns. As someone with little coding experience I hope to practice to better create an environment I can create what is needed for my interests.

## Experience
I currently have minimal experience in the following:
+ Python
+ R
